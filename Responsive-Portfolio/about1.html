	<h1>Daniel Munoz</h1>
	<h2>I am a college sophomore, probably studying right now. I go to UT Austin, where I plan to major in Computer Science. I like coffee, it is the only thing that can make me study for several hours straight, the only thing that can make me code at a speed of 100 wpm, and more importantly, the only thing that can make me actually crawl off my bed in the morning. I like math, computers, videogames, and music. I've worked doing some websites for companies and some individuals, I can't deny the pay is good. I love design and creativity, thinking outside the box, and really not following rules if they constrain you in any creative way. My favorite text-editor for code is Atom, my favorite design software is Sketch and all the Adobe ones.  </h2>
